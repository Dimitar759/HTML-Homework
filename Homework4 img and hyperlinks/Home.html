    <h2 id = "about">About the breed</h2>

    <p>The <b>Rottweiler</b> is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle
    playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside world with a <q>self-assured aloofness</q>. A
    male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and
    lighter. The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength. A thickly
    muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait. A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm
    and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders
    belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he's
    not a toy breed, so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and socialization will harness a
    Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.

    <h2 id = "history">History of the breed</h2>

    <p>The Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest surviving dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman times. These
    dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs.This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the <i>"Rottweil butcher's dog"</i>. The butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog
    evolved which could also be used as a draught dog.
    <br>
    The buildup to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a> saw a great demand for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog">police dogs</a>, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">First</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Second World Wars</a>, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance,draught, and guard dogs.
    <br>
    In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club">American Kennel Club</a>. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, as it was the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2017,
    the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the eighth-most popular purebred dog in the United States.
